# Stencil Example with PDFKit (not working)

I tried several ways to add pdfkit to my stencil app for PDF generation. But I still fail. So I set up a minimal example:

- stencil init for an app
- removed the router and unneccessary components
- added pdfkit and blob-stream as dependencies
- made a link to click on for generating a pdf

I'm not able to get the app compiled to a running version.

I document my ways here, with the errors I got:

FIRST TRY: Without adjusting stencil.config.ts (i.e., without rollup plugins):

```bash
user@ubuntu-20-04-dev:~/workspace/pdfkit-stencil/pdfkit-minimal$ npx stencil build
[36:56.8]  @stencil/core

[ ERROR ]  Node Polyfills Required
           For the import "stream" to be bundled from ./node_modules/blob-stream/index.js, ensure the
           "rollup-plugin-node-polyfills" plugin is installed and added to the stencil config plugins (client). Please
           see the bundling docs for more information. Further information: https://stenciljs.com/docs/module-bundling

[37:01.4]  build failed in 3.05 s
```

SECOND TRY: With nodePolyfills as suggested:

```bash

THIRD TRY: With additional babel to handle the legacy decorators:

```bash
user@ubuntu-20-04-dev:~/workspace/pdfkit-stencil/pdfkit-minimal$ npx stencil build

[40:51.6]  generate lazy finished in 12.92 s
[40:51.6]  build finished in 14.94 s
```

BUT IN BROWSER (using `npm start` to run the app):

```
index-bad3e30f.js:3539 ReferenceError: require is not defined
    at app-root.entry.js:31694:14 undefined
```

The line it `app-root.entry.js` is `const fs$1 = require('fs');`

````

FOURTH TRY: With commonjs option `transformMixedEsModules` (not typed, but seems to work in the `stencil.config.ts`):

```bash
user@ubuntu-20-04-dev:~/workspace/pdfkit-stencil/pdfkit-minimal$ npx stencil build
[43:38.2]  @stencil/core

## General Stencil Getting Started

To start a new project using Stencil, clone this repo to a new directory:

```bash
npm init stencil app
```

and run:

```bash
npm start
```

To build the app for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

To run the unit tests once, run:

```
